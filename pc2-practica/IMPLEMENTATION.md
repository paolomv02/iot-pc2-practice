## Key Classes and Their Responsibilities

### 1. CiaSteelFaucet (Main Device)
- **Inherits from**: Device (EventHandler + CommandHandler)
- **Manages**: Complete device lifecycle and component coordination
- **Features**: WiFi connectivity, status reporting, company branding
- **Event Handling**: Responds to proximity detection events
- **Command Processing**: Handles valve and LED control commands

### 2. UltrasoundSensor
- **Inherits from**: Sensor (EventHandler)
- **Purpose**: HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance measurement
- **Events Generated**: PROXIMITY_DETECTED_EVENT, PROXIMITY_LOST_EVENT
- **Configuration**: 10cm threshold, 2-400cm measurement range
- **Features**: Automatic event generation based on threshold

### 3. RelayModule
- **Inherits from**: Actuator (CommandHandler)
- **Purpose**: Water valve control with timing capability
- **Commands Handled**: OPEN_VALVE, CLOSE_VALVE, OPEN_VALVE_TIMED
- **Features**: 5-second timed operation, state monitoring
- **Safety**: Automatic closure after timer expiration

### 4. Led (Framework Component)
- **Inherits from**: Actuator (CommandHandler)
- **Purpose**: Blue LED status indication
- **Commands Handled**: TURN_ON, TURN_OFF, TOGGLE_LED
- **Usage**: Device active status and proximity confirmation

## Operation Flow

1. **Initialization Phase**:
   - Device constructor creates all components
   - setup() calls device.initialize()
   - Welcome message displays company information
   - WiFi connection attempted if credentials provided
   - Status LED activated to indicate device ready

2. **Main Operation Loop**:
   - Continuous proximity monitoring via ultrasonic sensor
   - Event-driven response to hand detection
   - Timed water valve operations
   - Periodic status reporting every 2.5 seconds
   - Component state updates and timer management

3. **Proximity Detection Sequence**:
   - Ultrasonic sensor measures distance continuously
   - When distance ≤ 10cm: PROXIMITY_DETECTED_EVENT triggered
   - Device responds by opening water valve for 5 seconds
   - LED confirms detection and valve operation
   - Console logs proximity detection and valve status

## Design Patterns Applied

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Sensors generate events when conditions change
- Devices implement EventHandler to respond to sensor events
- Loose coupling between sensors and response logic

### Command Pattern (CQRS-Inspired)
- Actuators implement CommandHandler for control operations
- Commands encapsulate specific actions (OPEN_VALVE, TURN_ON_LED)
- Separation of event handling (read) and command processing (write)

### Observer Pattern
- Event and command handlers can be chained
- Framework supports handler propagation for complex workflows
- Flexible component interaction without tight coupling
